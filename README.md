# About Role Pooler
Role Pooler is a fairly simple Discord Bot that can pool/sync roles globally across servers. This isn't that useful for many servers, but there are some servers that this is definitely useful for. Servers that this is especially useful for are the Minecraft Abnormals Servers, which the bot was created to be used on.

## Usage
This bot was created soley to be used by the Minecraft Abnormals Servers so it won't be very useful for other servers.
<br> If you wish to still use this, you are free to build the bot from the repository here or fork it and customize it to your needs, just credit must be given! </br>
This bot depends on the [Disparser](https://github.com/SmellyModder/Disparser) command library.
